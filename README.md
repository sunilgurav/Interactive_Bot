# Interactive_Bot
The bot lists messages, reads the last messages, and schedules Webex meetings based on the provided access token.

**Setting up Bot Token**
In order for the application to work properly, you need to provide a Bot Access Token. Follow the steps below to set up the token:

Obtain a Bot Access Token from https://developer.webex.com/docs > Access the API.
Once you have the token, open your terminal or command prompt.
Use the following command to export the bot token:

export bot_token="<Bot Access Token>"

Replace <Bot Access Token> with the token you obtained earlier.
Run the command in the terminal to set the environment variable. Note: This step might vary depending on your operating system. Consult the documentation for your specific operating system if needed.
Once the token is set, you can proceed with running the application.
